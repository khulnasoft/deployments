# Khulnasoft Cloud Connector

### Overview

The Khulnasoft Cloud Connector is used in conjunction with Khulnasoft Platform SaaS Edition (Enterprise Plan) deployments. When deployed on local clusters, i.e., clusters on which Khulnasoft Platform is not deployed, the Khulnasoft Cloud Connector establishes a secure connection to the Khulnasoft Platform console, giving Khulnasoft Platform remote access to resources on the local clusters.

### Khulnasoft Cloud Connector Deployment Types
Following are the Deployment types that can be deployed in local cluster:
* [Helm](./kubernetes_and_openshift/helm)
* [Manifests](./kubernetes_and_openshift/manifests)
* [CloudFormation](./ecs/cloudformation/khulnasoft-ecs-fargate)
