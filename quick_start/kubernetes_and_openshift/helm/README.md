# Quick-start deployment of Khulnasoft Enterprise using Helm

The quick-start deployment is used to deploy Khulnasoft Enterprise in your Kubernetes cluster quickly and easily. It is suited for proofs-of-concept (POCs) and environments intended for instruction, development, and test but not for production environments. For deployment instructions, refer to the [khulnasoft-helm repository](https://github.com/khulnasoft/khulnasoft-helm/tree/2022.4/quick-start-deployment-not-for-production-purposes).

Ensure that you use the latest branch of the Khulnasoft Security Helm repository.

For production usage, enterprise-grade deployments, advanced use cases, and deployment on other Kubernetes platforms, deploy Khulnasoft Enterprise with the required Khulnasoft components (such as server, enforcers, scanner, so on.) on your orchestration platform. For more information, refer to the Product documentation, [Deploy Khulnasoft Enterprise](https://docs.khulnasoft.com/docs/deployment-overview).
